# OSI Model Deep Dive

In the early days of computing, different computer systems struggled to communicate with each other because each vendor had its own proprietary networking solutions. This led to incompatibility and a "walled garden" approach.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the OSI model in 1984 as a conceptual framework to address this. It provides a universal language and a standardized way for different computer systems to communicate, regardless of their underlying hardware or software.

The OSI model breaks down the complex process of network communication into seven distinct, abstract layers. Each layer has a specific set of responsibilities and functions.

When network issues arise, the layered approach helps isolate problems to a specific layer, making troubleshooting much easier.

Browsing > HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)

Download files > FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Send an email > SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
