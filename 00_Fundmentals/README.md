# üåê What is a Network?

A network is a collection of devices (such as computers, servers, switches, routers, printers, smartphones, etc.) that are connected together to share resources, data, and services.

# ‚úÖ Key Characteristics:

Connectivity: Devices (called nodes) are linked via wired (Ethernet, fiber) or wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) communication.

Communication: Enables data transfer using protocols like TCP/IP, which define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received.

Resource Sharing: Printers, files, applications, and internet access can be shared.

Centralization (optional): Some networks use centralized servers for management, security, or storage.

# üìö Types of Networks:

LAN - (Local Area Network)	Covers a small area like a home, office, or building.
WAN - (Wide Area Network)	Covers large areas; connects multiple LANs (e.g., the internet).
MAN - (Metropolitan Area Network)	Spans a city or campus.
WLAN - (Wireless LAN)	A LAN that uses wireless tech (e.g., Wi-Fi).
PAN - (Personal Area Network)	Small network for devices around an individual (e.g., Bluetooth).
